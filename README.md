# A Curated List of Resources on Thinking & Mental Models

Here is a curated list of books, articles, and websites about thinking, with a special focus on mental models. This list is designed to take you from foundational concepts to practical application.

## Books

This is where the deepest knowledge lies. The books are categorized from foundational texts on mental models to broader works on thinking, decision-making, and systems. (Links generally point to Goodreads for reviews and summaries).

### Core Books on Mental Models

1.  [***The Great Mental Models Series***](https://www.goodreads.com/series/282993-the-great-mental-models) **by Shane Parrish and Rhiannon Beaubien**
    * This is arguably the best starting point. The series is explicitly designed to teach the most useful mental models from various disciplines.
    * *Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts*
    * *Volume 2: Physics, Chemistry and Biology*
    * *Volume 3: Systems and Mathematics*

2.  [***Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84945.Poor_Charlie_s_Almanack) **edited by Peter D. Kaufman**
    * Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's business partner) is the modern popularizer of the "latticework of mental models" concept. This book is a collection of his brilliant, funny, and insightful talks. His speech, "The Psychology of Human Misjudgment," is a masterclass in itself.

3.  [***Superthinking: The Big Book of Mental Models***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43844933-superthinking) **by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann**
    * This book is like an encyclopedia of mental models. It presents over 300 models and groups them by purpose (e.g., how to make better decisions, how to solve problems). It's an excellent reference guide to have on hand.

### Foundational Books on Thinking and Decision-Making

4.  [***Thinking, Fast and Slow***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow) **by Daniel Kahneman**
    * A Nobel Prize winner's seminal work on the two systems that drive how we think: System 1 (fast, intuitive, emotional) and System 2 (slower, deliberative, logical). Understanding this duality is crucial for recognizing cognitive biases, which mental models help counteract.

5.  [***The Art of Thinking Clearly***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248196-the-art-of-thinking-clearly) **by Rolf Dobelli**
    * A concise and easy-to-read catalog of 99 common thinking errors, from cognitive biases to social fallacies. Each chapter is short and provides a clear example, making it a very practical guide to avoiding mistakes.

6.  [***Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35532283-thinking-in-bets) **by Annie Duke**
    * Written by a former professional poker player, this book reframes decision-making as a probabilistic process. It teaches you to separate the quality of your decision from the quality of the outcome, a powerful mental shift.

### Books on Systems Thinking (A Meta-Model)

7.  [***Thinking in Systems: A Primer***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) **by Donella H. Meadows**
    * Systems thinking is one of the most powerful meta-models you can learn. This short, accessible book is the definitive introduction to understanding how complex systems—from your business to the environment—work. It introduces concepts like feedback loops, stocks, and flows.

8.  [***The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6468.The_Fifth_Discipline) **by Peter Senge**
    * A classic in business and management that champions systems thinking as a cornerstone of successful organizations. It provides a framework for how groups of people can think and learn together more effectively.

## Articles & Essays

These are great for getting a powerful dose of insight in a shorter format.

1.  **["The Psychology of Human Misjudgment"](https://fs.blog/psychology-human-misjudgment/) by Charlie Munger**
    * This is the full transcript of the speech mentioned in *Poor Charlie's Almanack*. Munger outlines 25 cognitive biases that lead people astray. It is one of the most important texts on practical psychology ever written.

2.  **["How to Disagree"](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) by Paul Graham**
    * A simple but profound essay that outlines a hierarchy of disagreement, from name-calling at the bottom to refuting the central point at the top. It's a mental model for having more productive arguments and evaluating the quality of others' critiques.

3.  **[Warren Buffett's Annual Letters to Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html)**
    * These letters are a goldmine of clear thinking and mental models applied to business and investing. Concepts like "Circle of Competence," "Mr. Market," and "Moats" are explained with incredible clarity. They are all available for free on the Berkshire Hathaway website.

## Websites & Blogs

These resources provide a continuous stream of new ideas and applications.

1.  **[Farnam Street (fs.blog)](https://fs.blog/)**
    * This is the premier online destination for learning about mental models, run by Shane Parrish (author of *The Great Mental Models*). The site is dedicated to "mastering the best of what other people have already figured out." It features in-depth articles, a podcast, and a weekly newsletter. **If you only visit one website from this list, make it this one.**

2.  **[James Clear (jamesclear.com)](https://jamesclear.com/)**
    * While famous for his book *Atomic Habits*, James Clear's website is a treasure trove of articles on decision-making, productivity, and mental models. He has a gift for synthesizing complex ideas into simple, actionable frameworks.

3.  **[Wait But Why (waitbutwhy.com)](https://waitbutwhy.com/)**
    * Tim Urban uses long-form, stick-figure-illustrated posts to break down incredibly complex topics (procrastination, artificial intelligence, Elon Musk's companies). He is a master at building a mental model for the reader from the ground up, making difficult subjects feel intuitive.

4.  **[LessWrong (lesswrong.com)](https://www.lesswrong.com/)**
    * A community blog focused on "refining the art of human rationality." It can be more technical and philosophical, but it's a fantastic resource for deep dives into cognitive science, Bayesian reasoning (`P(A|B) ∝ P(B|A)P(A)`), and effective thinking.

## Key Concepts on Wikipedia

For a quick, high-level overview of foundational ideas, these Wikipedia articles are excellent starting points.

* **[Mental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model)**: The foundational concept of an internal representation of how something works in the real world.
* **[List of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)**: A comprehensive list of systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. This is an essential resource for understanding the "bugs" in our thinking.
* **[Cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)**: The main article explaining the concept of cognitive biases, their causes, and their effects on decision-making.
* **[Systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)**: An approach to problem-solving that views "problems" as parts of an overall system. This is a crucial meta-model.
* **[First principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle)**: The concept of breaking down a complex problem into its most basic, foundational elements that are known to be true.

> Happy learning! The journey of building a latticework of mental models is a lifelong pursuit that pays incredible dividends.
